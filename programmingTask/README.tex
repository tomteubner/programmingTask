#Set up

-> npm must be installed

    -Use command 'npm i' in the location folder, this will install all the needed Packages.
    -Start the Server with the command 'node index.js' or similar syntax.
    -The console Log will show assigned Port, if no enviromental Port is given Port 3000 is used.
        -> To assign a enviromental Port use 'export PORT=<PORT_number>'.
    -Interact with the server using your webbrowser with '<IP_of_server>:<PORT_of_server>/'

#Note
    This Implementation is only a prof of concept:

    ->If you request a Age over 18 hours it is set to 18 hours, because with an age over 18 a Timeout accours
    Possible SOLUTION:  rewrite the getEvents(abi, address, eventFilter, age) Function to call itself multiple times 
                        setting starting and endBlock to get all the requested Data

    -> Look of index.html is functional and minimalistic to prov that the REST API works

-> It works with Firefox, Safari is kinda buggy and jumps between input fields, Firefox is recommended.


#Used Packages
Web3    -> Interaction with blockchains
Axios   -> Interaction with REST API
express -> Host own Webserver/REST API

#REST API
GET /api/contracts/<address>/<eventFilter>/<age>
    ->Returnes Events with the name of <eventFilter> of the contract <address> in last <age> hours, to
    return all Events use 'allEvents'

#exported Functions
    getContracts(address) 
        -> returnes the Contract ABI from given <address> via the etherscan api

    getEvents(abi, address, eventFilter, age)
        -> returns the Contract events from the given <address> and <abi> in the 
        last <time> hours using the web3 contract.getPastEvents Function
            -> connects with Main Ethereum Net via infura using 'YluGFjpmE6UtZnJk5s4M'
            as account
